# BNN Reach Avoid

A repository for the paper "Probabilistic Reach-Avoid for Bayesian Neural Networks".

In this repository we present a minimal implimentation of our algorithm for certification of reach-avoid probabilities and our algorithm for synthesis 
of maximally certifiable policies (in the tabular representation case). These algorithms are heavily paralelized, but have been edited to run smoothly
on a laptop. Training takes roughly 15 minutes, certification takes more than an hour, and synthesis takes more than 2 hours on a M1 Macbook Pro. 

If you have any questions regarding the paper's theory of the implimentation here please email: mwicker@turing.ac.uk
